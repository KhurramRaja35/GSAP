# 🚀 GSAP Learning Journey  
This repository is a collection of all my practice work, experiments, and mini-projects while learning **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.  
My goal with this repo is to improve my animation skills, understand motion design principles, and eventually build smooth, modern, and interactive web experiences..

## 🎯 Why I Started Learning GSAP
GSAP is one of the most powerful JavaScript animation libraries used by companies like Google, Meta, and Apple.  
I wanted to learn GSAP because it helps bring websites to life with:

- Smooth and high-performance animations  
- Scroll-based interactions  
- Timeline-based control  
- Advanced UI motion effects  
- Professional-level transitions and micro-interactions  

This repo documents everything I learn along the way.

## 📂 What This Repo Includes
Each folder contains a small project or demo such as:

- **Basic GSAP Tweens** (fade, slide, scale, rotate animations)  
- **Timeline Animations (gsap.timeline)**  
- **ScrollTrigger Animations**  
- **Hero Section Animations**  
- **Card + Component Animations**  
- **Staggered animations**  
- **Trigger-based entrance effects**  
- **Parallax & scroll-based motion**  

Each folder may include:

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far
- How to animate elements using `gsap.from()` and `gsap.to()`
- Creating sequences with `gsap.timeline()`
- Using ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations  
- Adding reveal animations (fade-in, slide-in, stagger)  
- Smooth hero section transitions    
- How to structure animations for performance  

As I continue learning, I’ll keep updating this repo.
